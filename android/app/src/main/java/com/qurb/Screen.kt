 * One place in the app: one of the four under the tab bar, or one reached

 * from Files -- which lights up the tab it belongs to and goes back to it.
 *
 * Plain classes holding their views, not Fragments. The four are built the
 * first time each is shown and kept for the life of the activity, and changing
 * tab is swapping one child view for another: no transactions, no back stack
 * beyond the few places reached from others, no state to restore beyond which
 * tab was showing. Decision 0039 asks for an app that is light, and this is
 * the least machinery that does the job.
