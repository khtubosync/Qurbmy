//

//
//   - the daemon's live state (syncing, devices reachable, what is moving) is
//     polled often and cheaply, because it changes many times a second and
//     only the latest value matters;
//   - lists are fetched when their place is opened, and refreshed on a slower
//     beat, because they change rarely and are expensive to redraw under
//     somebody's cursor.

// The window opens on one of two things: setting a device up, or showing one.
// Asked before anything is drawn, because the answer decides which.
//
// True until the answer is in, so the timers at the bottom draw nothing for a
// device that may not exist: each of their commands refuses until it does.
